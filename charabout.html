    <h3>The Orange Cat</h3>
    <img class="imgsize1" src="images/orangecat.png" alt="The Orange Cat">
    <p><b>The Orange Cat</b> is the main protagonist and the titular character of the story. He is a kind-hearted and respected anthropomorphic cat with a sense of attitude. He often looks around for suspicious people that brings danger to his friends, and if it were to happen, he would try to end it and save his friends. Sometimes, he takes the risks for himself, and makes tough decisions on what is right and what is wrong. His overall look consists of an orange body with black stripes on his arms, legs, and tail, and black-colored eyes.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Black Cat Group</h3>

    <p><b>The Black Cat Group</b> are a group of five vicious anthropomorphic black cats at the school that engages in bullying for fun and for the money. They were formed five years before The Orange Cat came to the school. Aesthetically different to The Orange Cat, their overall look consists of a jet-black body with white stripes on their arms, legs, and tails, and white-colored eyes with pupils.</p>
