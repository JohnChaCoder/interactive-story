Guys, let's beat him up!\" They then attacked the innocent child violently underneath the puff smokes, until the student couldn't move anymore.\n\n\"Well, next time, bring the money to us, or else you will deserve another beating from us!\" the group said to the innocent student about how he should have money in his pocket. \"See you later, twerp!\" The group then leaves the scene, leaving the innocent student there on the floor unconsious.\n\nNoticing this, he thought to himself how he should handle that situation.

After several minutes into the fight, The Orange Cat was knocked out unconsious by the group themselves. He was taken to the nurses' office to get checked up for injuries, and has to stay home until he fully recovers.\n\nAfter he is fully recovered, he will prepare himself for the worst as he comes back to the group at lunch time.\n\nWhat would he do now?",

When they didn't find him, they gave up hope and returned to their home base.\n\n\"Well,\" the group said, \"He has disappeared from our very eyes like the wind. Return to our home base, everyone!\"\n\nOnce the group is gone, The Orange Cat then thought up the plans to take the group of bullies down. He has concieved the idea of placing a trap near the area the group usually meet at, and then confronting them about their negative aspects of their own actions. He wanted to make sure that he would change the group's actions and behaviors for his own good, so he accepted the idea himself, and went to the hobby shop after school to get a dummy person, a wallet, a pair of fake paper money that looks realistic but is actually not, a pressure plate with the included traps, and a pair of sandbags.\n\nThat night, he secretly snuck in to the school and went to put up his traps near the area where the Black Cat Group meetup; he places the dummy person in the area, adjusting him so that he looks like has been overshadowed by the group, and then puts the wallet filled with fake money inside one of the front pockets of the dummy. He then sets up the pressure plate and sandbags while hanging the wires near the walls, hiding them precisely so that the group will not see them so that it would be obvious to them. Finally, he lifts the sandbags to the roof, and hid them so that the group will not notice.\n\nThe next day, at lunch time, he came across the group again, hoping to get their attention.\n\n\"What do you want?\" the group asked.\n\n\"I have a very special surprise for all of you guys,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh! What is it?\" the group replied. \"I hope it might be that person with a lot of money in its pockets!\"\n\n\"Well, lucky for all of you guys,\" said The Orange Cat, \"I do!\"\n\nWith excitement, the Black Cat Group ran to the spot where The Orange Cat set up his traps, and found the dummy person lying on the ground. They then went ahead and searched for the wallet in one of the pockets, and when they found it, they open it up to find some money that was actually fakes.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" the group responded, \"Are you sure this is the real money or not?\"\n\nWhat would The Orange Cat say to them?",

There went The Orange Cat.\n\nThe Black Cat Group walks up to him and teased him for his puny little trap he has set up, saying, \"What kind of an orange cat would set a trap for us like this? You did it to yourself, and pretty soon you will be out of here. We'll be seeing you very soon, loser!\"\n\nThe group laughed and walked away, leaving The Orange Cat unconsious.\n\nA few hours later, he was seen by the principal and asked, \"What in the world happened here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" says The Orange Cat as he wakes up from unconsiousness, \"I guess there must be something that happened here at school just recently.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" the principal said. \"Please tell the truth. If not then I will have to send you to the office to talk about your actions.\"\n\nThe Orange Cat then sighs and replied to him that he was the one that set up the trap for the Black Cat Group, to the principal's dismay.\n\n\"Okay, here's the truth: I was the one setting up the traps,\" he said. \"I set them up so that I can make them learn a lesson of their actions about bullying. But that plan failed when I accidently pressed that pressure plate on the ground and these sandbags were on top of me now. I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe principal then informs him that while he was glad that The Orange Cat said the truth about it, he asks him about how did he get the traps in at school, because he doesn't remember seeing them there yesterday.\n\nThe Orange Cat asks him that he set them up yesterday night while no one was at the school, just so that he can precisely get the group and confront them about their actions.\n\n\"I set up these traps up yesterday night,\" he said. \"I did it precisely so that I can get them in the right timing and place and then confront them for their actions.\"\n\nThe principal wasn't liking what The Orange Cat was saying, so he told him that while The Orange Cat got the traps in school, he did it by just breaking into the school doors secretly and then putting up the traps and leaving the school and making sure that everything stays put. So, to make sure that The Orange Cat doesn't do something like that ever again, the principal has to suspend him for a month so that everything needs to be set back to normal before The Orange Cat returns from suspension. Plus, he has to call home and notify them that The Orange Cat was doing something not appropriate at school even when it is closed.\n\nAfter school, The Orange Cat tries to cheer himself up by forgetting that the event should've never happened that way for him and that he will try to make it better next time, but by the time when he got home, his parents forced him to ask about his actions that he did at school, and The Orange Cat was in no choice but to tell the truth to his parents. After he tells the truth, his parents were outraged by his actions and subsequently punishes him from doing whatever he wants to do for five months, and is now going to be homeschooled because of his own actions.\n\nThe Orange Cat is now very, very depressed.\n\nOver the course of five months, the Black Cat Group continues to do their acts of bullying at school non-stop, while The Orange Cat has to be homeschooled and has to rethink his ways of dealing with situations from now on. After five months, he returns to school but is a completely different person from before; A cat that has no sense of bravery, justice, and responsibility to save his friends and people from the bullies, and is only focusing on his own schoolwork and classes. From this point forward, the Black Cat Group still continues to bully a number of innocent students at the school to this day, while The Orange Cat participates and attends school like an average student. The group's actions will never change, and neither The Orange Cat's way of life moving forward.\n\nGAME OVER! You didn't avoid the trap in time.

At that momemt, the Black Cat Group was completely recovered from unconsiousness, not feeling weakened anymore.\n\n\"Alright,\" the group said, quietly to themselves, \"Once The Orange Cat is no longer in school, we will continue to do our things like we want to do for the money!\"\n\n\"What did I just hear?\" the principal responded as he overheard the group's conversation.\n\n\"Nothing,\" says the group as they continue to act like they're already down.\n\nAfter school, The Orange Cat tries to cheer himself up by forgetting that the event should've never happened that way for him and that he will try to make it better next time, but by the time when he got home, his parents forced him to ask about his actions that he did at school, and The Orange Cat was in no choice but to tell the truth to his parents.

From this point forward, the Black Cat Group still continues to bully a number of innocent students at the school to this day, while The Orange Cat participates and attends school like an average student.

Got it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the group replies.\n\nLater that day, The Orange Cat walked up to the hallways to see the Black Cat Group kindfully giving back the cash they stole to the students they used to bully as a group, making The Orange Cat feel proud of himself. The Black Cat Group had now gone from being a bullying group into a respectful and kind-hearted group that helps the school community.\n\nThe elementary school that The Orange Cat has been in is now free of bullies that plagued the school for five years, and now has bullying monitors and advisors around the school monitoring for any kind of bullying happening around the school. One day, The Orange Cat saw a small group of new bullies secretly attacking and teasing one student in the corners of the hallways, but the advisors in the hallways were quick enough to go to that small group and suspend them from being in the school for two weeks. The Orange Cat knew everything worked out after that day, and at that moment, he walked up to the hall of fame and saw his name in one of the plaques that the principal had set up. He was honored as a hero of anti-bullying, making him more proud than he thinks.\n\nDo The Orange Cat and the Black Cat Group go out together for anti-bullying events?",
