He has concieved the idea of placing a trap near the area the group usually meet at, and then confronting them about their negative aspects of their own actions. He wanted to make sure that he would change the group's actions and behaviors for his own good, so he accepted the idea himself, and went to the hobby shop after school to get a dummy person, a wallet, a pair of fake paper money that looks realistic but is actually not, a pressure plate with the included traps, and a pair of sandbags.\n\nThat night, he secretly snuck in to the school and went to put up his traps near the area where the Black Cat Group meetup; he places the dummy person in the area, adjusting him so that he looks like has been overshadowed by the group, and then puts the wallet filled with fake money inside one of the front pockets of the dummy. He then sets up the pressure plate and sandbags while hanging the wires near the walls, hiding them precisely so that the group will not see them so that it would be obvious to them. Finally, he lifts the sandbags to the roof, and hid them so that the group will not notice.\n\nThe next day, at lunch time, he came across the group again, hoping to get their attention.\n\n\"What do you want?\" the group asked.\n\n\"I have a very special surprise for all of you guys,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh! What is it?\" the group replied. \"I hope it might be that person with a lot of money in its pockets!\"\n\n\"Well, lucky for all of you guys,\" said The Orange Cat, \"I do!\"\n\nWith excitement, the Black Cat Group ran to the spot where The Orange Cat set up his traps, and found the dummy person lying on the ground. They then went ahead and searched for the wallet in one of the pockets, and when they found it, they open it up to find some money that was actually fakes.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" the group responded, \"Are you sure this is the real money or not?\"\n\nWhat would The Orange Cat say to them?",
